My Cybersecurity Journey (started at 15)

Hi. I am Dark Raikiri, and yes, it is not my real name. I am starting my journey to become a red teamer. This is a summary of everything I've done until now.

My First 9 days in Cybersecurity

Focused areas- Linux basics, Networking Fundamentals, significant hands-on experience
-----

What i did-
1) Before starting everything, I educated myself about VirtualBox. I immediately downloaded VirtualBox (latest version) in which I downloaded KaliLinux.
2) Downloaded important books that would teach me linux basics and would also provide some examples of hands-on experience.
3) Watched Youtube videos for learning about Networking fundamentals. 
4) Completed the rooms like 'Offensive Security', 'Linux Fundamentals Part- 1' and 'Networking Fundamentals Part -1' in 'Tryhackme'.
5) Installed 'Snort' and 'Metasploit' in my VirtualBox. 
6) Scanned my home wifi using 'nmap'.
-----

Key Skills Learned-
1) Could use basic commands in Linux like 'find', 'ls', 'cat', 'pwd', 'cd', etc.
2) Learned text manipulation and used commands like 'grep', 'tail', 'head', 'nl', 'sed', etc.
3) Introduction to 'nmap' and 'ping', and applied it practically in my VirtualBox and tested it on Family devices.
4) Learned about Networking Basics and Layer 2 understanding, frames, switches, packets, routers.

what's next- 
-OSI models deep dive.
-More about different commands in Linux.
-Getting started with more hands-on from HacktheBox.

Target-
-Master Linux and a gain significant amount of knowledge about Networking in 2 months.
