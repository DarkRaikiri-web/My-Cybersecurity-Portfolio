Hello, it's me after a week of grinding again for Linux and Networking.
---


Things i did so far in Linux-
1) i can use commands like 'ifconfig' to check my IP and MAC addresses.
2) I can change my IP and MAC address. (Note- i immediately regretted it, all my nwetwork connection from my virtual box were cut off, i restarted my PC due to panic ðŸ˜…)
3) I can assign myself a new IP address by using dhclient.
4) I have started learning Bash Scripting and the file attached here are the pictures taken of my first Bash script, (i know it is not too good)

Things i did so far in Networking-
1) Deep Dive into OSI and TCP/IP models as i promised last week :)
2) I got a basic knowledge about each OSI layer, i.e. layer 1- Physical, Layer 2- Data Link, Layer 3- Network, Layer 4- Transport, Layer 5- Session, Layer 6- Presentation, Layer 7- Application.
3) I learned all important port numbers, their protocols and port type by heart <3
4) Got a basic knowledge of Access point, DNS server, DHCP, NAT, Default Gateway (known as IP address of our router that connects our LAN to the Internet.
5)  Learned difference between private and public IP.

Things i couldn't do-
1) I couldn't begin with Python.
2) I wasn't able to complete target chapters in 'Linux basics for hackers' and 'Network basics for hackers'.
---
Thinngs to be noted-
1) NEVER EVER change your MAC address and IP address without any information about the new MAC or IP address
2) In Linux, try to avoid writing files names with spaces, it can cause errors in commands. To avoid these errors, use quotation marks (" ")

Overall, this week was very less productive and I couldn't do most of the things thatwere the targets. I think that i should try to avoid burn outs and slacking off during my studies.
