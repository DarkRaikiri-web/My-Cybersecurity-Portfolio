Hello, it's me after a week of grinding again for Linux and Networking.

Things i did so far in Linux-
-i can use commands like 'ifconfig' to check my IP and MAC addresses.
-I can change my IP and MAC address. (Note- i immediately regretted it, all my nwetwork connection from my virtual box were cut off, i restarted my PC due to panic ðŸ˜…)
-I can assign myself a new IP address by using dhclient.
-I have started learning Bash Scripting and the file attached here are the pictures taken of my first Bash script, (i know it is not too good) 

Things i did so far in Networking-
-Deep Dive into OSI and TCP/IP models as i promised last week :)
-I got a basic knowledge about each OSI layer, i.e. layer 1- Physical, Layer 2- Data Link, Layer 3- Network, Layer 4- Transport, Layer 5- Session, Layer 6- Presentation, Layer 7- Application.
-I learned all important port numbers, their protocols and port type by heart <3
-Got a basic knowledge of Access point, DNS server, DHCP, NAT, Default Gateway (known as IP address of our router that connects our LAN to the Internet.
